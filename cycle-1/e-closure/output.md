Enter the number of states in the NFA: 4
Enter epsilon transitions (ε) for each state:
Number of ε-transitions from q0: 2
Enter state 1: 1
Enter state 2: 2
Number of ε-transitions from q1: 1
Enter state 1: 3
Number of ε-transitions from q2: 0
Number of ε-transitions from q3: 0

Epsilon-closures of states:
ε-closure(q0): {q0 q1 q2 q3 }
ε-closure(q1): {q1 q3 }
ε-closure(q2): {q2 }
ε-closure(q3): {q3 }
